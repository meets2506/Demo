# 📦 Qualcomm Nano LLM Packaging Architecture – Demo README

## Overview

This system delivers a lightweight, on-device AI-powered Q&A experience. It integrates a compact transformer-based language model (QwenNano LLM), semantic and keyword-based search technologies, and real-time natural language understanding. Designed for edge devices, it enables fast and private inference with optional voice input through a Whisper-style (OpenAI) speech-to-text module.

## ✅ Features

- 🤖 **On-Device LLM Inference:** Utilizes QwenNano — a compact, transformer-based language model optimized for real-time performance on edge devices.
- 🔍 **Context-Aware Search:** Combines semantic vector search and traditional BM25 keyword matching for high-relevance responses.
- 🗣️ **Voice Query Support:** Integrates Whisper-style (OpenAI) speech-to-text for natural spoken input.

## 📦 System Components

| Component               | Description                                           |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Inference Engine        | Executes the embedded QwenNano language model         |
| Voice-to-Text (STT)     | Converts voice input into text using Whisper-style STT |
| Vector Search Engine    | Performs semantic similarity search on input queries  |
| BM25 Document Search    | Retrieves relevant documents using keyword matching   |

---

## 🧪 Workflow

1. User inputs a question via text or voice.
2. If voice, input is transcribed to text using STT.
3. Text is vectorized and passed to search modules.
4. System retrieves context using:
   - Vector-based semantic search
   - BM25 keyword-based retrieval
5. Retrieved context is passed to the LLM for answer generation.
6. Final response is returned to the user.
